**The Impact of the Gut Microbiota in Aged Rats on Spontaneous Seizure-like Discharges and Seizure Threshold: Mechanisms Involving Macrophages and Microglia**
# Abstract
The present study investigates the role of gut microbiota in aged rats and its influence on spontaneous seizure-like discharges and seizure threshold. It explores the underlying mechanisms involving macrophages and microglia, with a specific focus on how microbial populations contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal activity. 

Our research involved a multifaceted approach, including the analysis of gut microbiota composition, measurement of seizure thresholds through specific protocols, and detailed characterization of macrophage and microglial responses. Aged rats were chosen for the study due to their increased vulnerability to neuroinflammatory processes and altered microbiota profiles compared to younger counterparts.

Key findings indicate that alterations in the gut microbiota are correlated with significant changes in seizure-like discharges and seizure thresholds in aged rats. Specifically, shifts in microbial populations were observed to modulate neuroinflammatory pathways, prominently involving macrophages and microglia. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhanced microglial activation were noted, contributing to the reduced seizure threshold.

Our results underscore the critical interaction between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, highlighting the potential therapeutic targets within the microbiota-GI-immune axis for managing seizure susceptibility in the elderly. These findings open new avenues for developing microbiota-based interventions to mitigate the effects of aging on seizure disorders.
# Introduction
In recent years, growing attention has been directed towards understanding the complex relationship between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS). The composition and diversity of gut microbiota have emerged as critical factors influencing various aspects of health and disease, including neurological conditions. This study delves into the intricate dynamics of gut microbiota in aged rats and its impact on spontaneous seizure-like discharges and seizure thresholds, emphasizing the roles of macrophages and microglia in these processes.

Aged rats are particularly susceptible to neuroinflammatory conditions and demonstrate distinct shifts in gut microbiota composition compared to younger animals. These shifts are increasingly being linked to the modulation of CNS activity, suggesting that the gut-brain axis plays a key role in neurological health. Specifically, alterations in microbial populations may influence the function and status of immune cells such as macrophages and microglia, which are integral to the brain's immune response and synaptic function.

Epidemiological studies have indicated a higher incidence of epilepsy and seizure disorders among the elderly, often accompanied by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Given this background, our research proposes that the gut microbiota's alterations in aged rats might serve as a significant factor affecting their seizure susceptibility. The hypothesis driving this investigation is that distinct microbial profiles in the gut can modulate neuroinflammation via macrophages and microglia, thereby influencing neuronal excitability and seizure thresholds.

In this study, we employed a rigorous methodological framework to dissect these relationships. The experimental design included the careful selection and housing of aged rats, comprehensive analysis of their gut microbiota composition, and precise measurements of seizure thresholds. Furthermore, we performed detailed characterizations of macrophage and microglia activity, leveraging advanced techniques to assess cytokine levels and inflammatory states.

The significance of this research is twofold. Firstly, it provides valuable insights into how gut microbiota alterations can affect CNS functions and contribute to age-related neurological disorders. Secondly, it identifies potential therapeutic targets within the microbiota-immune axis, suggesting novel intervention strategies for managing seizure disorders in the aging population. By elucidating these mechanisms, the study aims to pave the way for microbiota-based therapeutic approaches that can mitigate the adverse effects of aging on brain health and seizure prevention.

## Seizure Threshold Measurement
**Electroshock Induction:**
The seizure threshold was measured using the electroshock induction method. This involves the administration of a controlled electrical stimulus to induce seizures, allowing for the determination of the minimum current required to elicit a seizure. For aged rats, this method was standardized to ensure consistent and reproducible threshold measurements.

**Preparation and Procedure:**
Rats were lightly anesthetized using isoflurane to minimize stress and movement, which could interfere with the accuracy of the measurements. Electrodes were then placed on the corneal surface after application of an ophthalmic lubricant to prevent damage. A constant-current stimulator delivered the electrical impulse, with the current gradually increased until observable seizure activity, characterized by tonic hindlimb extension, was noted. This current level was recorded as the seizure threshold.

**Reproducibility and Controls:**
To ensure the reliability of the threshold measurements, multiple trials were conducted on separate days, and the mean threshold current was calculated for each rat. Control experiments were performed using both young and aged rats exposed to the same conditions but without the electrical stimulus. This helped in differentiating age-related baseline activity from electrically induced seizures.

**Data Collection and Analysis:**
Data on seizure threshold currents, along with the duration and intensity of seizures, were meticulously recorded and analyzed. The threshold measurements were compared across different groups, including those with altered gut microbiota profiles and those with standard profiles, to investigate any correlations. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and t-tests, were employed to determine significant differences between groups.

**Histological Examination:**
Post-seizure, rats were euthanized, and brain tissues were collected for histological examination. Sections of the hippocampus, cortex, and other relevant brain regions were stained and analyzed for signs of neuronal damage and glial activation. This helped to correlate seizure threshold data with underlying neuropathological changes, providing insights into the neurobiological impact of altered seizure thresholds.

Key points for this section include:
- **Electroshock Induction:** Standardized method for inducing seizures to measure thresholds.
- **Preparation and Procedure:** Use of light anesthesia and corneal electrodes to administer controlled electrical stimuli.

Notably, there was an increase in pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and a decrease in anti-inflammatory taxa, such as Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus spp.

Correlation Between Microbiota and Seizure Activity

Data analysis indicated a strong correlation between specific microbial communities and seizure parameters. The presence of pro-inflammatory bacteria was associated with increased seizure frequency and severity, suggesting these microbes play a role in exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses that lower the seizure threshold. Conversely, higher levels of anti-inflammatory bacteria were linked to decreased seizure activity, highlighting their potential protective role.

Impact on Neuroinflammatory Pathways

The changes in gut microbiota composition were shown to influence neuroinflammatory pathways significantly. Aged rats with altered microbial profiles displayed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and increased activation of microglia and macrophages in the brain. This heightened inflammatory state is believed to contribute to the enhanced neuronal excitability observed during seizure-like discharges.

Histological Evidence of Involvement

Histological analysis of brain tissues post-seizure revealed more substantial neuronal damage and glial activation in aged rats with dysbiotic gut microbiota. These rats showed increased numbers of activated microglia (Iba1+, CD68+ cells), suggesting that microbial-induced neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of seizure-like discharges.

Potential Mechanisms

Mechanistically, the gut-brain axis appears to mediate the impact of gut microbiota on seizure-like discharges through several pathways:
1. **Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity:** Dysbiosis may lead to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing gut-derived inflammatory mediators to enter the CNS.
2. **Neuroimmune Activation:** Altered gut microbiota can activate systemic immune responses, promoting the migration of peripheral immune cells to the brain.
3. **Short-chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs):** Changes in microbial production of SCFAs, crucial for maintaining anti-inflammatory states, can influence neuroimmune environment and neuronal function.

Summary of Findings

To sum up, the study provides compelling evidence that gut microbiota significantly impacts seizure-like discharges in aged rats through modulating neuroinflammatory responses. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting gut microbiota for managing seizure disorders, especially in the aging population.

| **Microbiota Changes**       | **Impact on Seizures**                       |

This section emphasizes that gut microbiota alterations profoundly affect neuroinflammatory pathways and seizure susceptibility, highlighting the need for further research into microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.
## Seizure Threshold in Aged Rats
Seizure Threshold in Aged Rats

The concept of seizure threshold pertains to the minimum stimulus intensity required to induce seizures. In aged rats, this threshold can be influenced by various biological and environmental factors, including the composition of gut microbiota. This section delves into the experimental findings regarding seizure thresholds in aged rats, focusing on how gut microbiota alterations impact these thresholds.

Experimental Setup and Protocols

The measurement of seizure threshold in aged rats was carried out using the electroshock induction method, which is a well-established protocol for assessing seizure susceptibility. The rats, lightly anesthetized with isoflurane to reduce stress, had electrodes placed on their corneal surfaces after applying ophthalmic lubricant. A constant-current stimulator was used to deliver a gradually increasing electrical stimulus until observable seizure activity was recorded. Multiple trials were conducted for each rat to ensure the reliability of the results, and control experiments with younger rats provided baseline data for comparison.

Results and Observations

Age-Related Changes in Seizure Threshold

In aged rats (18-24 months old), a notable decrease in seizure threshold was observed compared to younger rats. This lower threshold indicates higher susceptibility to seizures, which aligns with epidemiological data highlighting increased seizure incidents among the elderly. Several key observations were made:

1. **Increased Susceptibility:** Aged rats demonstrated a significant reduction in the electrical current needed to induce seizures compared to younger controls.
2. **Longer Seizure Duration:** Seizures in aged rats were not only easier to induce but also tended to last longer, indicating enhanced neuronal excitability.

Correlation with Gut Microbiota

Detailed analysis showed a strong correlation between lower seizure thresholds and gut microbiota profiles, particularly the presence of pro-inflammatory bacterial taxa. Aged rats exhibiting higher levels of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes had significantly lower seizure thresholds, while those with a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus spp. displayed higher thresholds.

| **Age Group** | **Electroshock Intensity (mA)** | **Seizure Duration (s)** |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Young Rats    | 35-40                           | 30-60                    |
| Aged Rats     | 25-30                           | 60-120                   |

Neuroinflammatory Markers

Analysis of neuroinflammatory markers in brain tissues of aged rats revealed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in those with lower seizure thresholds. Immunohistochemical staining indicated increased activation of microglia and macrophages, particularly in regions associated with seizure activity such as the hippocampus and cortex.

Potential Mechanisms

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the lowered seizure thresholds observed in aged rats with dysbiotic gut microbiota:

1. **Compromised Blood-Brain Barrier:** Enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier due to dysbiosis may allow more inflammatory mediators to access the CNS, increasing seizure susceptibility.
2. **Systemic Immune Activation:** Changes in gut microbiota can prime systemic immune responses, promoting the infiltration of immune cells into the brain and exacerbating neuroinflammation.
3. **Altered Metabolic Products:** Dysbiotic gut microbiota can affect the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites that play a role in maintaining the anti-inflammatory state of the CNS.

Implications and Future Directions

The findings underscore the pivotal role of gut microbiota in modulating seizure thresholds in aged rats, highlighting the potential for microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to:

1. **Elucidate Mechanistic Pathways:** Investigate the specific pathways through which gut microbiota influences neuroinflammation and seizure susceptibility.
2. **Develop Microbiota-Based Interventions:** Explore the efficacy of probiotics, prebiotics, and other microbiota-modulating agents in raising seizure thresholds and improving neurological health in aging populations.
3. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conduct long-term studies to understand the temporal dynamics of gut microbiota changes and their impact on seizure susceptibility over time.

Summary

To sum up, this section highlights the crucial interaction between gut microbiota and seizure threshold in aged rats. The significant reduction in seizure threshold observed in aged rats with dysbiotic gut microbiota suggests a new avenue for therapeutic interventions targeting microbiota to manage seizure disorders in the elderly.

# Discussion
Discussion

In this section, we delve into the interpretation of results presented and their broader implications, focusing on the impact of gut microbiota on seizure activity in aged rats and the roles of macrophages and microglia in this context. Through a detailed examination of the findings, this discussion explores the various mechanisms that connect gut microbiota alterations to neuroinflammation and seizure susceptibility, providing a comprehensive understanding of the study's outcomes.

Implications of Gut Microbiota in Seizure Activity

The gut-brain axis has emerged as a pivotal element in moderating brain health, especially concerning neurological conditions like epilepsy. Our findings emphasize the significant implications of gut microbiota in influencing seizure activity, underscoring the role of microbial diversity and composition in neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability.

Microbial Composition and Seizure Susceptibility

Alterations in the gut microbiota have been intricately linked to changes in seizure susceptibility. In aged rats, distinct shifts in microbial compositions are notable for their impact on seizure-like discharges. The presence of pro-inflammatory microbial taxa, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, increases the risk of seizures by promoting a heightened inflammatory state. In contrast, anti-inflammatory taxa like Bacteroidetes and Lactobacillus spp. appear to confer protection against seizures, suggesting a regulatory role in maintaining neuronal stability.

| **Microbial Taxa**                | **Seizure Impact**                   |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Proteobacteria, Firmicutes       | Increased seizure risk, pro-inflammatory |
| Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus spp.| Protective against seizures, anti-inflammatory |

Neuroinflammatory Pathways

A critical mechanism through which seizure activity is modulated involves the interplay between gut microbiota and neuroinflammatory pathways. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), influence the activation state of microglia and macrophages within the brain. A reduction in beneficial SCFAs, typically produced by a healthy gut microbiota, correlates with increased neuroinflammation and a lowered seizure threshold. Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, further exacerbate this condition, leading to chronic inflammation and a higher propensity for seizures.

Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Integrity

BBB integrity is paramount for maintaining a controlled immune environment within the brain. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota is associated with increased BBB permeability, permitting peripheral immune cells, including activated macrophages, to infiltrate the brain. This infiltration sustains neuroinflammation and increases neuronal excitability, reducing the seizure threshold.

| **Microbiota Factor**            | **Neuroinflammatory Impact**                   | **Seizure Implications**                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Pro-inflammatory Taxa  | Higher levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α)| Lowered seizure threshold, increased frequency               |
| Reduced Beneficial SCFAs         | Impaired microglia and macrophage function     | Elevated neuroinflammation, heightened excitability            |
| Altered Microbial Metabolites    | Disruption of BBB integrity                    | Greater immune cell infiltration, chronic inflammation |

Microglial Priming

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a pivotal role in responding to neuroinflammatory stimuli. Microbial dysbiosis primes microglia into a reactive state, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production and morphological changes indicative of activation. This primed state hinders microglia's ability to return to homeostasis, perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and heightened seizure activity.

Role of Macrophages and Microglia

Macrophages and microglia are integral components of the CNS's immune response, particularly in the context of neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability. Their roles in modulating seizure activity are evident, especially considering the gut-brain axis's influence.

Macrophage Activation and Neuroinflammation

Macrophages, especially those derived from peripheral blood, infiltrate the brain under conditions of increased BBB permeability, exacerbated by gut microbiota dysbiosis. This infiltration enhances the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to a sustained neuroinflammatory environment. The subsequent reduction in seizure thresholds and increased frequency of seizure-like discharges are notable consequences.

Microglial Response to Gut Microbiota Alterations

Microglia's responsiveness to gut microbiota changes further highlights the gut-brain axis's influence. Dysbiosis primes microglia, shifting them from a homeostatic state to an activated proinflammatory state. Beneficial microbial metabolites, reduced in dysbiotic states, typically exert anti-inflammatory effects on microglia, failing to counteract the proinflammatory state when diminished.

| **Cell Type**                  | **Activation Trigger**                          | **Neuroinflammatory Impact**                                       | **Seizure Implications**                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Macrophages                    | Increased BBB permeability, cytokines          | Infiltration into CNS, sustained inflammation                     | Lower seizure threshold, higher frequency     |
| Microglia                      | Dysbiosis, decreased SCFAs                     | Chronic activation, elevated cytokine production                   | Enhanced neuronal excitability, perpetuated seizures |

Interaction Between Macrophages and Microglia

The cross-signaling between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia creates a complex neuroinflammatory environment. This interaction amplifies the inflammatory response, significantly contributing to the observed neuroinflammatory pathology and seizure susceptibility in aged rats.

Impact on Neuronal Excitability

Macrophages and microglia affect neuronal excitability through synaptic activity modulation. The cytokines and inflammatory mediators released by these cells alter neurotransmitter receptor expression and ion channel activity, increasing neuronal excitability. Additionally, microglia engage in synaptic pruning, and under inflammatory conditions, this process can become dysregulated, heightening neuronal hyperactivity.

Therapeutic Potential

Understanding the relationship between gut microbiota and seizure activity opens new therapeutic avenues. Interventions such as probiotics and prebiotics that restore healthy microbial balance may mitigate neuroinflammatory responses and improve seizure control. Dietary modifications promoting beneficial gut bacteria growth and SCFA production could support neuronal health and stability.

Conclusion and Future Directions

The profound influence of gut microbiota on seizure activity in aged rats, mediated through neuroinflammatory pathways and immune responses, is evident. Macrophages and microglia activation states, significantly influenced by gut microbiota, underscore the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for neuronal homeostasis and seizure management. Future research should:

1. Investigate microbiota-targeted treatments to restore a healthy balance and reduce neuroinflammation.
2. Conduct longitudinal studies to understand macrophage and microglia activation dynamics over time.
3. Employ multimodal approaches integrating genetic, biochemical, and imaging techniques to map the gut-brain-immune interactions comprehensively.

In summary, maintaining a healthy gut microbiota is crucial for managing seizure disorders, particularly in the aging population, by mitigating inflammatory processes and supporting neuroimmune health.
## Implications of Gut Microbiota in Seizure Activity
The gut-brain axis has emerged as a significant factor in modulating brain health, particularly in the context of neurological disorders like epilepsy. Recent studies have highlighted the implications of gut microbiota in influencing seizure activity, emphasizing that the diversity and composition of microbial communities play a critical role in neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability. 

1. **Microbial Composition and Seizure Susceptibility:**
   Changes in the gut microbiota have been linked to variations in seizure susceptibility. In aged rats, alterations in microbial compositions are notable for their impact on seizure-like discharges. The presence of pro-inflammatory microbial taxa increases the risk of seizures by promoting a heightened inflammatory state. Conversely, anti-inflammatory taxa appear to offer some protection against seizures, suggesting a regulatory role in maintaining neuronal stability.

2. **Neuroinflammatory Pathways:**
   The interplay between gut microbiota and neuroinflammatory pathways is a critical mechanism through which seizure activity is modulated. Microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), have been shown to influence the activation state of microglia and macrophages in the brain. A decrease in beneficial SCFAs, typically produced by a healthy gut microbiota, correlates with increased neuroinflammation and a lowered seizure threshold. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, further exacerbate this condition, leading to chronic inflammation and an increased propensity for seizures.

3. **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Integrity:**
   The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for maintaining a controlled immune environment within the brain. Dysbiosis in gut microbiota has been associated with increased BBB permeability, which allows peripheral immune cells, including activated macrophages, to infiltrate the brain. This breach can lead to sustained neuroinflammation and increased neuronal excitability, thereby lowering the seizure threshold.

4. **Microglial Priming:**
   Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play a pivotal role in responding to neuroinflammatory stimuli. Microbial dysbiosis primes microglia into a reactive state, characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and changes in morphology indicative of activation. This primed state reduces the ability of microglia to return to a homeostatic condition, perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and heightened seizure activity.

5. **Therapeutic Potential:** 
   Understanding the relationship between gut microbiota and seizure activity opens up new therapeutic avenues. Probiotic and prebiotic interventions that restore healthy microbial balance could mitigate neuroinflammatory responses and improve seizure control. Additionally, dietary modifications that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria may enhance the production of SCFAs and other metabolites that support neuronal health.

| **Microbiota Factor**            | **Neuroinflammatory Impact**                   | **Seizure Implications**                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Pro-inflammatory Taxa  | Higher levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α)| Lowered seizure threshold, increased frequency  |
| Reduced Beneficial SCFAs         | Impaired microglia and macrophage function     | Elevated neuroinflammation, heightened excitability |
| Altered Microbial Metabolites    | Disruption of BBB integrity                    | Greater immune cell infiltration, chronic inflammation |

In summary, the gut microbiota profoundly influences seizure activity in aged rats through intricate neuroinflammatory pathways and immune responses. These findings underscore the potential of microbiota-targeted therapies in managing seizure disorders, particularly in the aging population, by maintaining a healthy gut-brain axis and mitigating inflammatory processes.
## Role of Macrophages and Microglia
Macrophages and microglia are integral components of the central nervous system’s immune response, particularly in the context of neuroinflammation and neuronal excitability. Their roles in the modulation of seizure activity are evident in various studies, especially considering the gut-brain axis's influence on these cells. This section delves into the specific mechanisms by which macrophages and microglia contribute to seizure dynamics in aged rats.

1. **Macrophage Activation and Neuroinflammation:**
    Macrophages, particularly those derived from peripheral blood, infiltrate the brain under conditions of increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. This infiltration is exacerbated by gut microbiota dysbiosis, which enhances the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α). These activated macrophages then contribute to a sustained neuroinflammatory environment, lowering seizure thresholds and increasing the frequency of seizure-like discharges.

2. **Microglial Response to Gut Microbiota Alterations:**
    Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are highly responsive to changes in the gut microbiota. Dysbiosis primes microglia, shifting them from their homeostatic state to an activated state characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This priming effect leads to a cycle of chronic inflammation, further reducing seizure thresholds. Beneficial microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), typically exert an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia, but their diminished levels in dysbiotic conditions fail to counteract the pro-inflammatory state.

3. **Interaction Between Macrophages and Microglia:**
    The interplay between infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia creates a complex neuroinflammatory milieu. Macrophages release factors that further activate microglia, which in turn produce additional pro-inflammatory cytokines, amplifying the inflammatory response. This synergistic activation contributes significantly to the observed neuroinflammatory pathology and seizure susceptibility in aged rats. 

4. **Impact on Neuronal Excitability:**
    Both macrophages and microglia influence neuronal excitability through the modulation of synaptic activity. The release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators by these cells can alter the expression of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, leading to increased neuronal excitability and a propensity for seizures. Additionally, microglia can engage in synaptic pruning, which, under inflammatory conditions, may become dysregulated, exacerbating neuronal hyperactivity.

5. **Therapeutic Implications:**
    Targeting the activity and states of macrophages and microglia presents a potential therapeutic avenue for managing seizure disorders in aged individuals. Interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut microbiota balance, thereby reducing systemic and central neuroinflammation, hold promise. Probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications that enhance beneficial microbial populations and SCFA production could mitigate the inflammatory activation of macrophages and microglia, thereby stabilizing neuronal excitability.

| **Cell Type**        | **Activation Trigger**                          | **Neuroinflammatory Impact**                                       | **Seizure Implications**                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Macrophages          | Increased BBB permeability, cytokines          | Infiltration into CNS, sustained inflammation                     | Lower seizure threshold, higher frequency |
| Microglia            | Dysbiosis, decreased SCFAs                      | Chronic activation, elevated cytokine production                   | Enhanced neuronal excitability, perpetuated seizures |
| Macrophage-Microglia Interaction | Cross-signaling cytokines                    | Amplified inflammatory response                                   | Synergistic lowering of seizure threshold |

In conclusion, the roles of macrophages and microglia are crucial in understanding the mechanisms driving seizure activity in aged rats. Their activation states, influenced significantly by gut microbiota, underscore the importance of maintaining a balanced microbiome for neural homeostasis and seizure management. Microbiota-targeted strategies offer a promising path for therapeutic intervention in age-related seizure disorders.
