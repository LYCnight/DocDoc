# Impact on Biodiversity
Climate change exerts a significant and multifaceted impact on biodiversity, affecting ecosystems, species distributions, and the intricate relationships within habitats. This section delves into these effects, emphasizing the urgency of intervention to preserve the planet's biological diversity.

Species Distribution
One of the most noticeable impacts of climate change on biodiversity is the alteration in species distribution. As global temperatures rise, many species are shifting their habitats toward higher altitudes and latitudes in search of suitable climates. This migration can lead to new competitive dynamics and disrupt existing ecological networks.

| Species       | Traditional Range                      | Current Range                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Moose         | Northern US, Canada                    | Farther north into Arctic regions    |
| American Pika | Western US mountaintops, cooler areas | Higher altitudes, more restricted    |
| European Butterflies | Mild European climates          | Shifting northwards, higher altitudes|

The shift in ranges can result in range contraction for some species, especially those adapted to specialized niches, potentially leading to increased risk of extinction.

Changes in Phenology
Phenology, the timing of biological events, is being altered by climate change. Species that rely on specific environmental cues for activities like migration, breeding, and flowering are particularly vulnerable. For example, the earlier onset of spring and the subsequent longer growing season have caused mismatches in timing between predators and their prey or between pollinators and the plants they energize.

- **Bird Migration**: Many bird species are arriving at breeding grounds earlier than usual, but if their prey (like insects) hasn't yet emerged, they face food shortages.
- **Flowering Plants**: Plants are blooming earlier than their pollinators awaken from diapause, resulting in reduced pollination success and seed production.

These phenological shifts can lead to a cascade of ecosystem impacts as interconnected species fail to synchronize their life cycles.

Habitat Loss and Fragmentation
Climate change contributes to habitat loss and fragmentation through phenomena like sea level rise, desertification, and increased frequency of wildfires. These changes not only reduce the availability of suitable habitats but also isolate wildlife populations, limiting genetic diversity and reducing resilience to environmental changes.
