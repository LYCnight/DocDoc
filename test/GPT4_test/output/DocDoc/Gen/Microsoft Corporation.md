# History
Microsoft Corporation was founded on April 4, 1975, by childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The company started by developing and selling BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. Gates and Allen's vision of the potential for software played a crucial role in the company's early success.

In its initial years, Microsoft operated out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, focusing on programming languages, with Altair BASIC gaining popularity among enthusiasts. The company relocated to Bellevue, Washington, in 1979, positioning itself closer to Seattle's tech hub.

**Founding and Early Years**

Microsoft Corporation was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, two childhood friends with a shared passion for computer programming. The company was originally established to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. Gates and Allen saw the potential for software to be as important as hardware, a vision that would drive the company's early growth and success.

The foundation of Microsoft was laid when Gates and Allen spotted an article about the Altair 8800 in Popular Electronics magazine. Recognizing the opportunity to create software for this new microcomputer, they contacted the manufacturer, MITS (Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems), and proposed developing a BASIC interpreter. Despite not having an Altair or even written the code, they were confident they could deliver. After a successful demonstration, MITS agreed to distribute their software, and Microsoft was born.

In the early years, Microsoft operated out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where MITS was based. The company initially focused on creating programming languages, and their first product, Altair BASIC, quickly gained popularity among hobbyists and computer enthusiasts. This early success provided the financial stability needed to expand their operations and hire more employees.

By 1979, Microsoft had outgrown its Albuquerque base and moved to Bellevue, Washington. This relocation marked a significant step in the company’s development, positioning it closer to the burgeoning tech hub in Seattle. During this period, Microsoft expanded its product line to include versions of BASIC for other computers and began developing its own operating systems.

A pivotal moment in Microsoft's early history came in 1980 when the company secured a contract with IBM to provide an operating system for their upcoming personal computer. This deal led to the creation of MS-DOS, a product that would become the foundation for Microsoft's dominance in the software industry. MS-DOS's success established Microsoft as a key player in the rapidly growing personal computer market.

In 1985, Microsoft launched the first version of its Windows operating system, which introduced a graphical user interface (GUI) to the MS-DOS environment. Windows was designed to make computers more accessible to a broader audience, offering a more intuitive way to interact with the machine. Although the initial release was modestly received, it laid the groundwork for future versions that would revolutionize personal computing.

**Growth and Expansion**

In the years following its founding, Microsoft Corporation experienced significant growth and expansion, driven by its strategic vision, innovative products, and key partnerships. This period marked the transformation of Microsoft from a small startup into a global technology powerhouse.

One of the pivotal moments in Microsoft's growth was the development and success of the MS-DOS operating system. After securing the contract with IBM in 1980, MS-DOS became the standard operating system for IBM PCs and their clones, cementing Microsoft's position in the software industry. This widespread adoption provided the company with a steady revenue stream and the resources needed to invest in further innovations.

The introduction of the Windows operating system in 1985 was another major milestone. Although the initial version of Windows was not an immediate success, subsequent iterations, particularly Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1, gained widespread popularity. These versions offered improved graphical user interfaces and greater ease of use, attracting a broader audience and solidifying Microsoft's dominance in the PC market. By the early 1990s, Windows had become the most widely used operating system in the world.

Microsoft's growth was also fueled by its expansion into new markets and the diversification of its product offerings. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company introduced Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity applications that included Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Microsoft Office quickly became the industry standard for office software, further enhancing the company's market position.

The 1990s were marked by Microsoft's aggressive expansion into the internet and networking sectors. The release of Windows 95 in 1995 was a landmark event, as it included built-in support for the Internet and introduced features like the Start menu, which became iconic. Around the same time, Microsoft launched Internet Explorer, rapidly gaining market share in the burgeoning web browser market.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Microsoft continued to grow through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. Notable acquisitions included Forethought, the company behind PowerPoint, and Visio Corporation, which added diagramming software to Microsoft's portfolio. These acquisitions allowed Microsoft to enhance its product offerings and maintain a competitive edge.

Microsoft's expansion was not limited to software. The company diversified into hardware with the launch of the Xbox gaming console in 2001. The Xbox quickly became a major player in the gaming industry, competing with established brands like Sony and Nintendo. Microsoft's foray into hardware demonstrated its ability to innovate and succeed in new markets.
