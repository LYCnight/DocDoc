### Meaning of Each Field:
- "id": Represents the unique identifier of each directory item, used to distinguish between different directory items.
- "heading": Represents the title of each directory item, describing its content.
- "level": Represents the level or depth of the directory item. "0" usually indicates a first-level directory, "1" indicates a second-level directory, "2" indicates a third-level directory, and so on. For example, for the directory item with id 0, its "level" is 0, indicating that it is the title of the text; for the directory item with id 1, its "level" is 1, indicating that it is a first-level title. This field helps us understand the hierarchical structure of the directory.

### Directory Structure Rules:
All texts can be classified according to the depth of the directory:
- Shallow: Shallow directory structure, with levels ranging from 0 to 1, linear narrative, and no multiple-level directory items.
    - Fiction, News, Opinion articles
- Medium: Multi-level directory structure, with levels ranging from 0 to 3, containing multiple-level directory items.
    - Academic paper, Encyclopedia article
- Deep: Deep directory structure, with levels ranging from 0 to 6, containing deeply multi-level directory items.
    - IT: Software Development Report
    - Medicine: Clinical Study Report
    - Finance: Risk Assessment Report
    - Education: Course Evaluation Report
    - Law: Case Assessment Report
    - Management: Project Management Report
    - Manufacturing: Manufacturing Process Report

Q: I want to write an opinion article about Trump's defeat in the 2020 US presidential election, titled "2020 US Election | Three Reasons for Trump's Defeat." Please generate the table of contents for me.
A:
-- Analysis:
Opinion articles belong to the Medium category of text, with levels typically ranging from 0 to 3. When writing this opinion article, I believe setting the maximum level to 2 is more appropriate, i.e., level = 0~2. When composing an opinion article, the main goal is to elucidate and support our viewpoints. In this article about Trump's defeat, all three reasons are major points of discussion, while specific examples and arguments serve as sub-points that support these major points. Therefore, each reason (parent entry) should depend on the detailed items used to explain or support it (child entries).
