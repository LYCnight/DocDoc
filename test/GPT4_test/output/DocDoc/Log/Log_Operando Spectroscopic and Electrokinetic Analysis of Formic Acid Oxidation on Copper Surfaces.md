In the section on **Spectroscopic Analysis**, the paper delves into the detailed examination of the spectroscopic properties of copper surfaces during the oxidation of formic acid. This analysis is pivotal in understanding the surface interactions and chemical changes occurring during the reaction.

The spectroscopic techniques employed include:

- **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR)**: This technique is used to identify the functional groups and assess the chemical bond changes in the catalyst during the reaction. The IR spectra provide insights into the adsorption of formic acid and its intermediates on the copper surface.
- **Raman Spectroscopy**: Raman spectroscopy complements IR by providing detailed information on the vibrational modes of the chemical species present on the copper surface. It is particularly useful in observing changes under different operational conditions.

The findings from these spectroscopic analyses are presented in a series of spectra, each corresponding to different stages of the reaction process. Key observations include:

- The appearance and intensity changes of specific peaks, indicating the formation and consumption of intermediates.
- Shifts in peak positions, suggesting changes in the electronic environment of the copper surface.

These observations are crucial for constructing a detailed mechanistic pathway of formic acid oxidation on copper. The section concludes with a discussion on how these spectroscopic insights correlate with the electrokinetic data, setting the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic process.

This analysis not only enhances the understanding of copper's catalytic behavior but also aids in optimizing the catalyst design for improved performance in real-world applications.
