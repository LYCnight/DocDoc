# Apple Inc.

Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Known for its innovations in consumer electronics, computer software, and online services, Apple is one of the largest and most valuable companies in the world. The company's success is reflected in its strong brand loyalty and distinct product lines, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. 

## Founding and Early History

Apple Inc. was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The trio initially aimed to produce and sell personal computers. Their first product, the Apple I, was hand-built by Wozniak and initially sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips). Apple was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. on January 3, 1977, with the launch of the Apple II, which was significantly more successful, becoming one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.

## Expansion and Innovation (1980s-2000s)

The 1980s were a significant period for Apple, marked by the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. The Mac's graphical user interface set a new standard for personal computing, although it faced strong competition from IBM-compatible PCs. The subsequent decade saw growing pains for Apple, with fluctuating profits and management changes.

Steve Jobs' return to Apple in 1997 marked a turning point. Apple began a series of innovative product releases, starting with the iMac in 1998, which featured a striking design and user-friendly setup. This period also saw the introduction of macOS, the iPod, iTunes, and the company’s transformation into a broader consumer electronics firm.
