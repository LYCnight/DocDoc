## Chapter 1: Introduction to Python

### History of Python

Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was released as Python 0.9.0 in 1991. The language was designed to be a successor to the ABC language and emphasizes code readability and simplicity.

### Installation and Setup

#### Installing Python

To start programming in Python, you need to install Python on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

1. **Download the Installer**: Choose the installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. **Run the Installer**: Follow the prompts and ensure that you check the option "Add Python to PATH" before installation in Windows. 
3. **Verify the Installation**: Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type `python --version` to ensure Python is correctly installed.

#### Setting Up a Development Environment

While Python can be used directly through the terminal, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can significantly enhance productivity.

- **IDLE**: Comes bundled with Python.
- **PyCharm**: A popular Python-specific IDE.
- **VS Code**: A versatile editor with excellent Python support when you install the Python extension.

### Basic Syntax and Structure

Python is known for its clear syntax and readability. Here are fundamental aspects of Python syntax:

#### Hello World

Here's a simple example to print "Hello, World!" in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### The Zen of Python

Python comes with a set of guiding principles known as "The Zen of Python". These principles can be displayed by running:

```python
import this
```

These principles emphasize simplicity, readability, and the importance of explicit over implicit behavior.

## Chapter 2: Python Fundamentals

### Variables and Data Types

#### Variables

Variables in Python are used to store data. Unlike other programming languages, you don't need to declare a variable type. Python determines the type based on the value you assign.

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True
```

#### Data Types

Python supports several data types:

- **Number**: int, float, complex
- **String**: str
- **Boolean**: bool
- **List**: list
- **Tuple**: tuple
- **Set**: set
- **Dictionary**: dict

### Operators

#### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example        |
|----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| `+`      | Addition              | `3 + 2`        |
| `-`      | Subtraction           | `3 - 2`        |
| `*`      | Multiplication        | `3 * 2`        |
| `/`      | Division              | `3 / 2`        |
| `%`      | Modulus               | `3 % 2`        |
| `**`     | Exponentiation        | `3 ** 2`       |
| `//`     | Floor Division        | `3 // 2`       |

#### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description           | Example        |
|----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| `==`     | Equal to              | `3 == 2`       |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `3 != 2`       |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `3 > 2`        |
| `<`      | Less than             | `3 < 2`        |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `3 >= 2`       |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `3 <= 2`       |

### Control Flow Statements

#### if, elif, and else

Control flow statements are used to execute code based on conditions:

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is negative")
```

#### for Loop

Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string):

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

#### while Loop

Repeats as long as a condition is true:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Chapter 3: Data Structures

### Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, meaning they can be changed after their creation.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[1])  # Outputs: banana
```

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable; once created, they cannot be modified.

```python
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0, 50.0)
print(coordinates[0])  # Outputs: 10.0
```

### Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique items.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.

```python
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
print(person["name"])  # Outputs: John
```

## Chapter 4: Functions and Modules

### Defining and Calling Functions

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword:

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Alice"))  # Outputs: Hello, Alice
```

### Lambda Functions

Anonymous, inline functions defined using the `lambda` keyword:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Outputs: 5
```

### Built-in Functions

Python provides many built-in functions like `len`, `range`, `print`, etc.:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(numbers))  # Outputs: 5
```

### Modules and Packages

Modules are files containing Python code. A package is a collection of modules.

```python
# Importing a standard module
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))  # Outputs: 4.0
```

## Chapter 5: Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects

Classes define a blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog1 = Dog("Rex")
print(dog1.bark())  # Outputs: Rex says woof!
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Outputs: Buddy says woof!
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class.

```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says meow!"

animals = [Dog("Buddy"), Cat("Whiskers")]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods within a single unit or class.

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Creating an account object
acc = Account("John", 100)

# Attempting to withdraw more than the balance
if acc.withdraw(150):
    print("Withdrawal successful")
else:
    print("Insufficient funds")
```
