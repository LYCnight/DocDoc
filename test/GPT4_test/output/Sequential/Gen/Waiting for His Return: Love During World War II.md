Sarah found herself longing for the day when she could hold her beloved in her arms once more. She clung to the promise they had made to each other before he left, a promise to reunite and build a life together. But as the war raged on, that promise seemed more and more like a distant dream.

Meanwhile, John faced the horrors of battle, his thoughts never far from the woman he loved. He wrote to Sarah as often as he could, pouring his heart out on the pages, desperate to feel connected to her. But the fear of never seeing her again haunted him, fueling his determination to survive and return home.
