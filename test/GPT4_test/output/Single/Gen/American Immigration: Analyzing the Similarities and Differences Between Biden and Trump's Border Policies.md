# American Immigration: Analyzing the Similarities and Differences Between Biden and Trump's Border Policies

Immigration has been a perennial and contentious issue in American politics, one that defines the ideologies of political parties and impacts the lives of millions. While the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden encapsulate distinctly different eras in the realm of American politics, analyzing their immigration policies reveals a mix of stark differences and some surprising continuities. Here, we dissect the border policies of both administrations to better understand their implications.

## **Policy Framework and Philosophy**

### **Donald Trump's Border Policies**

Donald Trump’s presidency was perhaps most famously marked by its hardline stance on immigration. His administration deployed a multitude of measures aimed at curbing both legal and illegal immigration, underscored by a nativist rhetoric. Key policies included:

- **Border Wall**: Central to Trump's campaign and presidency was the construction of a physical border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The move was aimed at outright preventing illegal crossings.
- **Zero Tolerance Policy**: Initiated in 2018, this policy resulted in the criminal prosecution of all apprehended illegal border crossers, leading to widespread family separations.
- **Tightening Asylum Regulations**: The Trump administration enacted multiple rules that restricted the eligibility for asylum, such as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) or "Remain in Mexico" policy, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings.
- **DACA and TPS Threats**: Attempts were made to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for individuals from certain countries.

### **Joe Biden's Border Policies**

Upon taking office, Joe Biden promised to reverse many of Trump’s immigration policies, subscribing to a more humanitarian and pragmatic approach. Key policy shifts included:

- **Halting Border Wall Construction**: One of Biden’s first actions was to cease the building of the border wall and redirect funds elsewhere.
- **Ending Family Separation**: Biden curtailed the Zero Tolerance policy, focusing instead on reuniting families and preventing the separation of children from their parents.
- **Reformed Asylum Process**: Biden aimed to scrap the MPP and make the asylum application process more accessible and just. However, operational difficulties have led to a piecemeal approach.
- **Protecting DACA and TPS**: Biden moved to fortify these protections, proposing legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and extending TPS.

## **Implementation and Effectiveness**

While intent and announcements serve as harbingers of change, the effectiveness and full enactment of policies can significantly vary.

| Aspect                | Trump Administration                           | Biden Administration                          |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Physical Barriers** | Strong emphasis on building border walls       | Halted construction, no expansion             |
| **Family Separation** | Implemented Zero Tolerance leading to separation| Reversed policy, aimed for reunification      |
| **Asylum Policies**   | Tightened eligibility, initiated MPP           | Attempted to ease process, faced logistical issues|
| **DACA and TPS**      | Sought to end protections                      | Strengthened protections, proposed citizenship pathways|

### **Challenges and Criticisms**

Both administrations faced unique challenges and criticisms in their approach to border security and immigration:

- **Trump**: Advocates contended his policies were necessary to protect national security, while critics decried the humanitarian crises prompted by family separations and overcrowded detention facilities.
- **Biden**: Supporters applaud his compassionate stance but highlight operational hurdles and slow reversals of Trump's stringent policies. Critics argue that the perceived leniency could incentivize illegal crossings, leading to increased numbers of migrants at the border.

## **Conclusion**

The border policies of Presidents Trump and Biden reflect inherently divergent philosophies: Trump's administration embraced stringent controls and punitive measures, while Biden's approaches emphasize humanitarian considerations and procedural fairness. Nevertheless, both have been targets of scrutiny and face practical challenges in implementation. As immigration continues to be a focal point in American politics, a comprehensive, balanced approach that addresses security concerns while upholding human rights remains ever crucial. The future of American immigration policy will likely depend on adeptly navigating the complex landscape shaped by both administrations' legacies.
