## 1. Introduction

The rise of online marketplaces has necessitated robust, scalable, and efficient e-commerce systems. This technical report outlines the development of an e-commerce platform utilizing Java Spring for the backend and React for the frontend. The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive and practical solution that addresses the typical requirements of modern e-commerce applications, from product management to user authentication and order processing.

## 2. System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration processes.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add/remove products and view the cart.
- **Order Processing**: Handle order placement and payment.
- **Search Functionality**: Enable users to search for products.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle increased load.
- **Maintainability**: The code should be clean and modular.
- **Security**: Ensure data security and protection against common vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: The system should exhibit low latency and high throughput.

## 3. Architecture and Design

### System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend. The backend uses Java Spring Boot to handle business logic and data management, while the frontend employs React to create an interactive user interface.

### Design Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Applied in both backend and frontend to separate concerns.
- **DAO (Data Access Object)**: To handle database interactions.
- **Service Layer**: To encapsulate business logic.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot, Hibernate
- **Frontend**: React, Redux
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, Jenkins

## 4. Development Process

### Agile Methodology

We adopted Agile methodology, specifically Scrum, to ensure iterative development and constant feedback. The project was divided into two-week sprints, with regular stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

### Version Control

Git was used for version control, with branches for features, bug fixes, and releases. Pull requests and code reviews were mandatory to maintain code quality.

## 5. Implementation Details

### User Authentication

- **Backend**: Spring Security was used for authentication and authorization. Passwords were hashed using BCrypt.
- **Frontend**: JWT tokens were used to manage user sessions.

### Product Management

- **Backend**: CRUD operations were implemented using Spring Data JPA. 
- **Frontend**: React components were created to manage the UI for adding, updating, and deleting products.

### Shopping Cart

- **Backend**: A service layer managed cart operations and ensured transactional integrity.
- **Frontend**: The state of the cart was managed using Redux.

### Order Processing

- **Backend**: Spring handled order creation, while integration with payment gateways was achieved using REST APIs.
- **Frontend**: Components were created to facilitate order review and payment.

### Search Functionality

- **Backend**: Implemented search endpoints using Spring Data JPA's querying capabilities.
- **Frontend**: Search features were implemented with dynamic filtering and sorting options.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Unit Testing

- **Backend**: JUnit and Mockito were used for unit tests.
- **Frontend**: Jest and React Testing Library ensured the reliability of React components.

### Integration Testing

Spring Test and Postman collections were used to validate the integration between different system layers.

### Load Testing

Apache JMeter was employed to simulate high load conditions and measure system performance.

### Code Quality

SonarQube was integrated into the CI pipeline to check for code quality and security vulnerabilities.

## 7. Deployment

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- **CI**: Jenkins was configured to build and test the application on each commit.
- **CD**: Docker images were created and deployed to Kubernetes clusters.

### Hosting

The application was hosted on AWS, leveraging services like EC2, RDS, and S3 for different components.

## 8. Conclusion

This e-commerce system based on Java Spring and React demonstrates a comprehensive approach to developing modern web applications. By adhering to software development best practices, leveraging robust frameworks, and employing a structured development process, we were able to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure e-commerce platform.
