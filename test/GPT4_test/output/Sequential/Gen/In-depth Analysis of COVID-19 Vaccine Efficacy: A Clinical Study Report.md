**7. Handling of Missing Data**

Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation methods. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the results to different assumptions about the missing data.

**8. Interim Analyses**

Interim analyses will be conducted at predefined time points to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. These analyses will be performed by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC) and will follow a group sequential design to control the overall type I error rate.

**9. Software and Tools**

All statistical analyses will be performed using validated statistical software, such as R or SAS. The choice of software and specific packages used will be documented in detail.

**10. Reporting of Results**

The results of the statistical analyses will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines. All tables, figures, and listings will be clearly labeled and include appropriate footnotes and explanations.

**11. Amendments to the SAP**

Any amendments to the SAP will be documented, justified, and approved by the study's principal investigator and statistician before implementation.

This Statistical Analysis Plan ensures that the analysis of the clinical trial data is rigorous, transparent, and reproducible, thereby providing reliable and valid conclusions about the efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 vaccine.
