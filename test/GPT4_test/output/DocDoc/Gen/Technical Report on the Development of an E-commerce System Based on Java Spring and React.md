Continuous Deployment extends Continuous Integration by automatically deploying every code change that passes the CI pipeline to production. This ensures that the application is always in a deployable state.

1. **CD Workflow**:
    - **Deployment Pipeline**: The deployment pipeline is triggered after a successful CI build. This pipeline includes stages for further testing, staging deployment, and production deployment.
    - **Automated Testing**: Additional automated tests, such as end-to-end tests and performance tests, are executed to verify the application's functionality and performance in a production-like environment.
    - **Staging Deployment**: The application is deployed to a staging environment, where it undergoes final validation. User acceptance testing (UAT) can be performed here.
    - **Production Deployment**: If the application passes all tests in the staging environment, it is automatically deployed to the production environment using deployment strategies like Blue-Green, Canary, or Rolling deployments.

2. **Deployment Strategies**:
    - **Blue-Green Deployment**: Maintains two identical production environments (Blue and Green). The new version is deployed to the idle environment and traffic is switched once verified.
    - **Canary Deployment**: Gradually rolls out the new version to a small subset of users, monitoring performance before a full rollout.
    - **Rolling Deployment**: Incrementally replaces instances of the old version with the new version to ensure continuous availability.

3. **Post-deployment Monitoring**:
    - **Monitoring and Logging**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK stack are used to monitor the application's health and performance. Alerts are set up for critical metrics.
    - **Rollback Mechanism**: In case of deployment failure, automated rollback mechanisms ensure the system can revert to the previous stable state.

**Benefits of CD**:
    - **Faster Time to Market**: Automated deployments enable faster release cycles and quicker delivery of new features and bug fixes.
    - **Reduced Deployment Risk**: Incremental and automated deployments reduce the risk of manual errors and deployment failures.
